### How it updates data
- The widget will try to download new data only after 12:00 PM (because before daily data aren't released).
- If a new day is started, but the data for the previous day are not released, the widget will try to 
download data even if the time is not after 12:00 PM.
- If daily data are not available, the widget will show the last available data.

> **Note**: Some data countries are partially available, so the graph could be partially empty (e.g. UK).
This is a problem of the Covid API.
